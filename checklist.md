## Philosophy Update

**OBFUSCII has achieved its core vision.** Temporal ASCII portraits work reliably, compress effectively, and scale responsively. The web deployment proves the concept in practice.

**The foundation is production-ready.** The system delivers on all technical promises with performance exceeding initial targets.

**Key breakthrough:** Real-world deployment demonstrates that ASCII video can work as practical technology, not just experimental art. The temporal portrait concept is validated through actual use.

**The core innovation is proven:** Text-based video that scales infinitely, loads instantly, and enables viral copy/paste distribution while maintaining recognizable human features.
