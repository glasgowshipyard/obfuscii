## Current Issues: Performance Optimization Phase

### Issue 1: Frame Rate Performance ❌ MAJOR ISSUE
**Problem:** Terminal playback running at ~2-3fps instead of target 30fps
**Impact:** Poor development experience, difficult quality assessment
**Status:** Needs investigation and optimization

### Issue 2: Compression Gap ❌ BLOCKING PRODUCTION
**Current:** 5:1+ compression ratio achieved
**Target:** 7:1+ compression ratio needed for web deployment
**Gap:** Need +2:1 improvement through parameter optimization
**Status:** Requires systematic parameter tuning

### Issue 3: Character Artifacts ⚠️ ONGOING
**Problem:** Single character flickers breaking RLE runs
**Impact:** Reduced compression efficiency
**Status:** Cleanup pipeline working but needs optimization

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
- [ ] **Compression parameter optimization** - Systematic tuning to achieve 7:1+ ratios
- [ ] **Frame rate performance investigation** - Identify and fix bottlenecks
- [ ] **Character artifact reduction** - Fine-tune cleanup pipeline

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Performance profiling** - Detailed analysis of pipeline stages
- [ ] **Quality vs compression balance** - Content-aware parameter selection
- [ ] **Web deployment optimization** - Production-ready performance

## Technical Reality Check

**What works:** Core pipeline, file format, web player, concept validation
**What needs work:** Compression ratios, frame rate performance, artifact reduction
**Production readiness:** Functional but not optimized for deployment

The system proves the concept and all components work, but requires optimization to meet production targets before Phase 2 feature expansion.
