## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT ISSUES: Performance Optimization Phase

### Issue 1: Frame Rate Performance
**Problem:** Terminal playback running at ~2-3fps instead of target 30fps

**Impact:** 
- Makes visual quality assessment difficult
- Artifacts appear worse than they actually are at proper speed
- Poor user experience for development workflow

**Analysis needed:**
- Is the bottleneck in decompression?
- Terminal rendering overhead?
- Frame timing logic?
- Memory allocation patterns?

**Priority:** High - affects all development and testing

### Issue 2: Compression Optimization Gap
**Current:** 5:1+ compression ratio achieved
**Target:** 7:1+ compression ratio needed for web deployment
**Gap:** Need +2:1 improvement through parameter optimization

**Contributing factors:**
- Single character artifacts breaking RLE runs
- Suboptimal cleanup stage aggressiveness
- Possible parameter combinations unexplored

**Approach:** Systematic parameter tuning across cleanup stages

**Priority:** High - needed before web player development

### Issue 3: Character Artifacts Reducing Compression
**Problem:** Single character flickers still present, fragmenting RLE runs

**Symptoms:**
- Random character changes between frames
- Compression efficiency reduced
- Visual quality degradation

**Possible causes:**
- Character boundary hysteresis threshold suboptimal
- Temporal smoothing window too small
- Spatial coherence algorithm still too conservative

**Investigation needed:**
- Profile which cleanup stages are most effective
- Test different hysteresis thresholds
- Analyze artifact patterns for systematic solutions

**Priority:** Medium - direct impact on compression targets

### Issue 4: Quality vs Compression Trade-off
**Problem:** Optimal balance between visual quality and compression ratio unclear

**Current approach:** All cleanup stages enabled with fixed parameters
**Need:** Content-aware parameter selection based on video characteristics

**Optimization vectors:**
- Different settings for motion vs static content
- Facial feature detection for preservation priorities
- Adaptive aggressiveness based on compression targets

**Priority:** Medium - needed for production use

## üìã INVESTIGATION TASKS

### Performance Profiling
**Goal:** Identify frame rate bottlenecks

**Method:**
1. **Time each pipeline stage** - conversion, cleanup, compression, decompression, display
2. **Memory usage analysis** - identify allocation patterns
3. **Terminal rendering measurement** - pure display overhead
4. **Comparison with reference implementation** - video-to-ascii baseline

**Expected outcome:** Targeted optimization approach

### Compression Parameter Space Exploration
**Goal:** Find optimal cleanup stage parameters for 7:1+ compression

**Method:**
1. **Systematic grid search** - test parameter combinations
2. **Content-specific optimization** - different settings for portrait vs motion content
3. **Quality preservation validation** - ensure face recognition maintained
4. **Compression ratio measurement** - quantitative improvement tracking

**Variables to optimize:**
- Hysteresis threshold (4-24 pixels)
- Spatial coherence aggressiveness (15-30% thresholds)
- Temporal smoothing window (3-7 frames)
- Cleanup stage enable/disable combinations

### Artifact Pattern Analysis
**Goal:** Understand and eliminate character flicker sources

**Method:**
1. **Frame-by-frame diff analysis** - identify change patterns
2. **Spatial distribution mapping** - where artifacts occur most
3. **Temporal pattern detection** - artifact frequency and persistence
4. **Algorithm effectiveness measurement** - which cleanup stages help most

**Expected outcome:** Targeted artifact reduction approach
