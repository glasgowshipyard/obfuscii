# OBFUSCII Issues - Current Status

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Terminal Playback
ASCII video playback functional with minor cosmetic issues.

### Working Features
- **Core playback:** Displays coherent ASCII video frames
- **Dynamic resizing:** Adapts to terminal window size changes in real-time
- **Frame scaling:** Properly downsamples frames to fit terminal dimensions
- **No scrolling:** Plays in-place without buffer accumulation
- **Face recognition:** Clear facial features visible in ASCII output

### Minor Issues (Acceptable)
- **Resize artifacts:** Window resizing causes temporary character scattering (cosmetic only)
- **Performance:** Playback speed acceptable for development use

**Status:** Production-ready for development use.

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Compression Progress
Significant improvement achieved through systematic optimization.

### Compression Evolution
- **Initial:** ~1.8:1 compression ratio
- **Progressive smoothing:** 4.5:1 compression ratio (2.5x improvement)
- **Baseline (no cleanup):** 4.4:1 compression ratio
- **Target achievement:** 5.0:1 compression ratio with spatial coherence enabled

### Working Components
- **RLE + LZMA algorithm:** Functional and producing consistent results
- **Character boundary hysteresis:** Mathematical overflow warnings resolved
- **Progressive smoothing pipeline:** Bilateral ‚Üí Gaussian ‚Üí Median filters working
- **Modular cleanup system:** 4-stage pipeline with enable/disable flags

**Status:** Core compression working, optimization needed for target ratios.

## ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUE: Stage 4 Spatial Coherence Destroys Faces

### Problem Statement
**Symptom:** ASCII video becomes blank screen when spatial coherence filtering enabled
**Impact:** 85,750 character changes (3.08% of all characters) eliminate facial features
**Evidence:** Face visible with Stage 4 disabled, disappears when enabled

### Systematic Debugging Results
**Method:** Disabled cleanup stages individually to isolate problem

**Stage Testing Results:**
- **Stage 1 (Isolated replacement):** Safe - 0 corrections, face preserved
- **Stage 2 (Run consolidation):** Safe - 0 corrections, face preserved  
- **Stage 3 (Temporal smoothing):** Safe - 54k+ corrections, helps compression
- **Stage 4 (Spatial coherence):** ‚ùå BROKEN - destroys face completely

**Proof of Concept:** 5.0:1 compression achieved with broken Stage 4, indicating higher ratios possible with correct implementation.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Algorithm flaw:** `fits_spatial_context()` function treats facial features as "noise"

**Specific issues:**
1. **Aggressive threshold:** 25% neighbourhood frequency too low
2. **Poor context detection:** Mistakes facial detail for compression artifacts
3. **No feature preservation:** Replaces important characters (`#` for eyes, `*` for texture)
4. **Uniform region bias:** Assumes all variation is noise rather than legitimate detail

**Result:** Facial features flagged as "outliers" and replaced with background characters.

### Research-Based Solution Identified
**Approach:** Apply salt-and-pepper noise detection principles from image processing literature

**Key insights from research:**
- **Target genuine outliers only:** Isolated pixels in uniform regions
- **Preserve intentional edges:** Don't modify legitimate transitions
- **Conservative thresholds:** Higher frequency requirements, uniform region detection
- **Median filter principles:** Replace only obvious noise, preserve detail

**New algorithm requirements:**
1. **15% neighbourhood frequency threshold** (vs current 25%)
2. **70% neighbourhood uniformity required** before flagging outliers
3. **Facial feature preservation:** Never touch `#`, `*`, `%`, `@` characters
4. **Edge region detection:** Preserve non-uniform neighbourhoods

## üìã IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Fix Spatial Coherence Algorithm
**Status:** Solution designed, ready for implementation

**Steps:**
1. **Replace broken functions:** `fits_spatial_context()` and `find_contextual_replacement()`
2. **Test fixed algorithm:** Verify logic on sample patterns
3. **Enable Stage 4 only:** Measure compression + visual quality
4. **Enable all stages:** Test combined cleanup performance

**Expected results:**
- **Face preservation:** Maintain visual quality with Stage 4 enabled
- **Compression improvement:** 5.0:1+ achieved without destroying features
- **Combined optimization:** 6-8:1 compression with all stages working

### Phase 2: Achieve Target Compression
**Goal:** 7:1+ compression ratio minimum, 10:1 target

**Approach:**
- **Parameter tuning:** Optimize thresholds for content type
- **Algorithm refinement:** Adjust based on test results
- **Content analysis:** Different strategies for portraits vs motion video

## üîç LESSONS LEARNED

### Successful Methodologies
1. **Systematic debugging:** Modular approach successfully isolated problem
2. **Research-driven solutions:** Academic literature provided exact guidance needed
3. **Incremental testing:** One stage at a time prevents compound failures
4. **Conservative approach:** Better to under-clean than destroy visual quality

### Failed Approaches
- **Parameter optimization spam:** Testing 50+ combinations ineffective
- **Aggressive cleanup:** High correction counts destroy content
- **Assumption-based fixes:** Need evidence-based algorithms

### Key Insights
- **Character count not bottleneck:** Same 10-character set as high-compression benchmarks
- **Motion vs static different:** Need appropriate algorithms for content type
- **Visual quality paramount:** Compression meaningless if content destroyed
- **Modular design essential:** Enable/disable flags critical for debugging

## üìà COMPRESSION TARGET STATUS

### Current Achievement
- **Baseline:** 4.4:1 compression (no cleanup)
- **Broken spatial coherence:** 5.0:1 compression (face destroyed)
- **Working stages only:** TBD (Stages 1-3 combined)

### Target Progression
- **Minimum acceptable:** 5:1 compression ratio ‚úÖ PROVEN ACHIEVABLE
- **Good performance:** 7:1 compression ratio ‚ùå NOT YET ACHIEVED
- **Target goal:** 10:1 compression ratio ‚ùå NOT YET ACHIEVED

### Path to Target
1. **Fix Stage 4:** Maintain 5.0:1+ with face preservation
2. **Optimize combined stages:** Achieve 6-8:1 with all stages
3. **Algorithm refinement:** Push toward 10:1 target
4. **Content-specific tuning:** Different approaches for different video types
